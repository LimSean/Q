## NOTICE
Make sure tell the entire group what activity you are working so that you don't work on same file(s) concurrently. Otherwise I have to manually resolve conflicts and it might result in efforts to be counterproductive.

Please update as you see fit for the README, so everyone is updated on the progress.
